## üßë‚Äçüíª Tips for New Contributors

- **Start small:** Begin with documentation, UI fixes, or refactoring tasks.
- **Read `CONTRIBUTING.md`:** Understand how to set up and contribute.
- **Understand the flow:** Explore how players register, how matches are scheduled, and how scores are updated.
- **Ask questions:** Don't hesitate to ask maintainers or others in the Discord server.

## üõ† Suggested First-Time Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
2. **Set up the backend** (Java + Spring Boot + PostgreSQL)
3. **Run the frontend** (React + TailwindCSS)
4. **Explore the app locally**
5. **Pick an issue and start contributing!**

---

## üêû Troubleshooting

Here are some common issues you might face while setting up or contributing, along with suggested solutions:

### 1. **Backend Not Starting (Java/Spring Boot Errors)**
- **Solution:** Ensure you have Java 17 or higher installed.
- Check if your PostgreSQL database is running and the credentials in `application.properties` are correct.

### 2. **Database Connection Failed**
- **Solution:** 
  - Make sure PostgreSQL is installed and the DB service is running.
  - Double-check your DB name, username, and password in the config files.
  - Check for any firewall or port blockages (default is port `5432`).

### 3. **Frontend Crashes or Doesn‚Äôt Load**
- **Solution:** 
  - Run `npm install` or `yarn` in the frontend directory to install dependencies.
  - Use `npm run dev` or `npm start` (depending on setup).
  - Ensure the backend server is running if the frontend depends on API calls.

### 4. **CORS Errors in Browser Console**
- **Solution:** 
  - Add CORS configurations in the Spring Boot backend (usually in a WebConfig file or Controller).
  - You can temporarily disable CORS in development using browser extensions (not recommended for production).

### 5. **Real-time Features Not Working (Socket.IO)**
- **Solution:**
  - Check if the backend server has Socket.IO setup and is running.
  - Confirm that both frontend and backend are using the correct socket URL and port.

### 6. **Build/Deployment Errors (Vercel, Render, Railway)**
- **Solution:**
  - Review build logs provided by the platform.
  - For frontend (Vercel), ensure the build command and output directory are correctly set in project settings.
  - For backend (Render/Railway), ensure environment variables are correctly configured.
